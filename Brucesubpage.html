<h2>BRUCE</H2>
  <h3>Born: 02/2006</h3>
  <h4>Adopted: 12/18/2008</h4>
  <h5>Died: 09/13/2011</h5>


  <p1>A Golden Retriever named Butterball conjures a very chubby dog. However, this Golden Retriever was very lean and had severe health problems that appeared to preclude his adoptability. I took him to our vet for a health evaluation to support his chance of adoption and in the process bonded with him. The vet's evaluation was that he had major health issues but could have a good, if not long, life with us. I decided that we should adopt him ourselves and renamed him Bruce. Bruce did have major health challenges and we even took him for an evaluation to a speciallty veterinarian hospital in northern California. Among other things, Bruce had Pica, which caused him to chew inappropriate things such as our rugs. Despite his challenges, he was a very gentle, sweet fellow and found a best friend when we adopted Zack a year and a half after adopting Bruce. Sadly, the vets were correct in predicting that Bruce would have a short life. Bruce had to be euthanized when he was 5 years old after living with us for 3 years. Ira keeps Bruce's ashes in a cabinet near his dresser.
